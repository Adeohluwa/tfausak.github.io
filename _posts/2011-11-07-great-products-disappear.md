title: Great Products Disappear
---

Recently, I lost my [Nexus S][1] and replaced it with a [Venue
Pro][2]. Microsoft got a lot of things right with Windows Phone 7,
compared to both iOS and Android. (I used an iPhone for two years
before the Nexus S.)

One particular detail struct me as insanely clever, but I didn't
even notice it until I described to my girlfriend what was going
on. When I pull my phone out of my pocket after getting a notification,
the screen turns on. Make no mistake, this is a tiny detail. But
it makes a huge difference. It's possible to see what the notification
is and unlock the phone without hitting any hardware buttons.

To me, that's emblematic of Microsoft's attention to detail with
Windows Phone 7. The phone knows when it comes out of your pocket
(thanks to its ambient light sensor). What else are you going to
do with it when you pull it out of your pocket? Why should you need
to hit a button to bring the screen up?

Noticing this detail about my phone made me aware of a bigger
concept: well-designed things are imperceptible. They do what they're
designed to do so well that you don't even think about it.
