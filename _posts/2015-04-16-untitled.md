many people assumed that i didn't know haskell that well

> I would suggest that you learn the community's syntax so you can interact with them more effectively. --- [mightybyte][1]

> Modify your understanding to be more compatible with idiomatic Haskell. --- [ReinH][2]

> I think you'll find that after becoming a little more experienced with Haskell it's perfectly possible to ignore most of these [operators like `$` and `.`] when reading code. --- [katieandjohn][3]

others assumed i didn't know math that well

> I remember the composition operator felt like it was backwards when I learned it in a math class. But then I had another ten years of math classes. --- [chreekat][4]

> If and when mathematics notation is reinvented then we can start composing things the "right" way round. --- [tomejaguar][5]

> I'm much more prone to trust mathematical precedent than the vagaries of syntax in programming languages. --- [amyers127][6]

others didn't like the imperative appearance

> I want to express things as to what they are in terms of value and not in terms of how to get to these values, which is what Imperative Programming does. --- [evohunz][7]

> You are thinking in "data transformation" anyway, but it just feels different to describe the value you want vs describing the computation you want. --- [evohunz][8]

> I don't see function application as English prose (read left to right), but rather a mathematical construct read from the argument. --- [amyers127][9]

others simply stated things that weren't true

> And (f . g) x or f . g $ x is common-sense, while x |> g |> f is counter-common-sense. --- [evohunz][10]
