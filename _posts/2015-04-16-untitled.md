My last post [introduced Flow][],
a library for writing more understandable Haskell.
The response to it [on Reddit][] surprised me.
It was more negative than I expected.

Many people who commented assumed that I didn't understand idiomatic Haskell.
This caught me off guard.
I explicitly talked about and showed idiomatic Haskell code.
Flow is an alternative to some of the current idioms.

Other people assumed that I did not understand math that well.
I can understand this because math was completely absent from my post.
That was intentional on my part;
I don't think it's helpful to pretend that programming and math are the same.
That being said,
I have taken ten years of math classes
and I understand how function composition works.

So far the comments I've shown have been personal attacks.
They seem to say that I would be okay with `.` and `$` if only I understood either Haskell or math better.
I think these types of comments are shitty,
but I guess they're to be expected on the internet.

These next comments were actual criticisms of Flow,
which I welcome.
Because Flow allows you to express operations as a pipeline,
it can look imperative.
Some people don't like that, which confused me.
Avoiding imperative-looking code in functional programming doesn't help anyone.
It's like saying you shouldn't use the imperative-looking [`for`][] because the functional-looking [`traverse`][] is superior.
Sometimes it makes more sense to think about things imperatively,
regardless of how they actually get evaluated.
That's the whole idea behind `do` notation!

This argument reminds me of the [useless use of `cat`][].
For the uninitiated, `cat` ends up in a lot of places where it's "useless"
because the program you pipe it into can do the same thing.
For example, each of these commands does the same thing:

{% highlight sh %}
$ cat a-file | grep a-pattern
$ grep a-pattern < a-file
$ grep a-pattern a-file
{% endhighlight %}

Depending on the circumstances, any one of those could be the best way to express yourself.
Flow tries to give you that freedom with Haskell.
Consider the following equivalent expressions:

{% highlight hs %}
aValue |> aFunction |> anotherFunction
anotherFunction . aFunction $ aValue
anotherFunction (aFunction aValue)
{% endhighlight %}

Sometimes it just makes more sense to think about transforming a value.
Other times it's better to compose a bunch of functions together.

I didn't mean to imply that you should use Flow all the time.
I think Flow allows you to write more understandable Haskell in certain circumstances.
I don't anticipate it completely replacing the existing idioms.
Perhaps I should have expressed this in my last blog post.
