- idiomatic haskell is sometimes pointfree
- https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree
- i typically dont write expressions as pointfree
- i use a tool called pointfree to transform them
- http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pointfree
- i dont always have pointfree installed
- since i generally work in sandboxes
- plus it takes a little while to install (~5m)
- people who idle in #haskell use lambdabot
- i dont usually use irc
- so i built a web site that does the same thing
- its called blunt
- https://blunt.herokuapp.com
- check out the project
- https://github.com/tfausak/blunt
- or the package
- https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blunt
- and since pointfree expressions can be a little challenging
- it also converts into pointful expressions
- http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pointful
- powered by warp, lucid, clay, jmacro, and wai-websockets
- all of which were great to work with
- warp https://github.com/tfausak/blunt/blob/v0.0.15/library/Blunt.hs#L37
- lucid https://github.com/tfausak/blunt/blob/v0.0.15/library/Blunt/Markup.hs#L15
- clay https://github.com/tfausak/blunt/blob/v0.0.15/library/Blunt/Style.hs#L15
- jmacro https://github.com/tfausak/blunt/blob/v0.0.15/library/Blunt/Script.hs#L14
