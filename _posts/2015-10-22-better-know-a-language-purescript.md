![The PureScript logo][1]

It's time for another installment of [OrgSync][2]'s "Better know a language"
series! (For a primer on the series, see [Better know a language: Kotlin][3].)
This time I covered [PureScript][4], a Haskell-like language that compiles to
JavaScript.

[The video][5] is available on YouTube. [The slides][6] are available here.
