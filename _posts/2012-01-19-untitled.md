the famigo logo is relatively simple
lets see if we can render it using html and css

start with super basic markup
its going to look a lot different when were done
but this is a good start

the logo uses clarendon [1]
thats not a web font though
georgia is close enough

each letter is going to need its own style
so lets put them all in spans
we could use a list
but that would be goofy

now each letter is colored
but theres too much space between them
we still want it to be one word

now lets rotate the letters
they kerning will be wrong
but just spinning them will go a long way
just open the image and measure angles
or just eyeball it

next up is baseline and kerning
aka vertical align and letter spacing
gotta fit those letters together snugly

the dot above the i is wrong
css doesnt let you color parts of letters
so lets split it
into a dotless i [2] and a tittle [3]

css doesnt do lighting effects
but we can fake it by masking a gradient

how can we do the stroke
if we do it with text stroke or shadow
itll get covered by the gradient mask
unfortunately we have to duplicate the content

the mask makes the text transparent
so the background has to be transparent
but with a colorful outline

adding the trails is next
unfortunately cant do bezier curves in css
circles will have to do

i wanted to animate the ball moving across the letters
but animating on top of the complicated css looks bad
it clips and ignore strokes
so thats a no go
