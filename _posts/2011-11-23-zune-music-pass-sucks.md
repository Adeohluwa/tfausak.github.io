title: Zune Music Pass Sucks
---

A few months ago, I lost my [Nexus S][1]. I bought it under contract
from T-Mobile without insurance, so I decided to buy a new phone.
Android consistently underwhelmed me, especially compared to the
iPhone I used for two years beforehand. I didn't want to get another
Android, and the iPhone doesn't play nicely with T-Mobile. So I
took the third option and bought a [Dell Venue Pro][2], which runs
Windows Phone 7.

I listen to a lot of music, almost exclusively through my phone.
Normally I listen to [Pandora][3] all day, but they don't have a
WP7 app. I looked around for alternatives and quickly found Microsoft's
[Zune Music Pass][4]. Their marketing blurb caught my eye:

>   A Zune Music Pass gives you unlimited access to millions of
>   songs you can stream or download and play on your Windows Phone,
>   PC, or Xbox 360.
>
>   Take advantage of powerful discovery tools like Mixview and
>   Smart DJ, which serve up music recommendations based on what
>   you already like.

## The Good

As you might expect, Zune has tight integration with Windows Phone
7. Finding songs is no different than finding apps, games, or
podcasts. The interface is clean, smooth, and fast. I've never had
any problems with it. Once you've found the songs you're looking
for, streaming or downloading them is a piece of cake.

Their "Smart DJ" service makes it easy to discover new music, too.
Just pick a song, artist, or album you like and it'll play more
stuff like it. It's not quite as good as Pandora, but it's close.

Zune has a web interface, but it seems like a lot more work went
into their desktop client for Windows. It's got all the same
information, but everything looks better and responds faster. Plus
it's got plenty of features that make you smile when you notice
them, like the spectrogram at the bottom.

## The Bad

The aforementioned desktop client is Windows-only, which leaves the
web interface for non-Windows folk like me. Their audio player uses
Silverlight, of course, so setting it up on Linux is a chore. But
the performance is even worse. Everything takes ages to load and
breaks playback unless you use their popout player.

I encountered strange behavior while using the Zune site: some songs
refused to play. I tried everything I could think of to no avail.
Finally I tweeted [@ZuneSupport][5] (their only official support
channel) and got [this response][6]: "Were you streaming from your
phone then tried to stream from the website?" Not at the same time,
just close to one another.

Microsoft claims you can stream music to your XBox 360, but the
fine print reveals that you need an XBox Live Gold membership to
do that. Since I don't have one and don't plan on shelling out
another $15/month for it, I don't know if it's any good or not.

## The Ugly

Plenty of music is totally absent from the Zune marketplace. For
instance, I'm a huge fan of [Cake][7], but none of their music
is available to me. It shows up when I search for it, but I can't
stream, download, or buy it.

That's not even the worst part, though. I can understand some music
not being available in their marketplace. Look at how long it took
Apple to get The Beatles into the iTunes Music Store. The worst
part is: you still have to *buy* some music! Even though you pay
$10/month for "unlimited access", you still have to pay for some
songs, albums, and artists.

I noticed this when I tried to get "Disco Science" by Mirwais. Turns
out it's not included with my Zune Music Pass. I might have bought
it, but I can't do that, either. I'd have to buy the entire album.
No thanks. I subscribed for a reason.
