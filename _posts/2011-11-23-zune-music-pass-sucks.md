title: Zune Music Pass Sucks
published: false
---

A few months ago, I lost my [Nexus S][1]. I bought it under contract
from T-Mobile without insurance, so I decided to buy a new phone.
Android consistently underwhelmed me, especially compared to the
iPhone I used for two years beforehand. I didn't want to get another
Android, and the iPhone doesn't play nicely with T-Mobile. So I
took the third option and bought a [Dell Venue Pro][2], which runs
Windows Phone 7.

I listen to a lot of music, almost exclusively through my phone.
Normally I listen to [Pandora][5] all day, but they don't have a
WP7 app. I looked around for alternatives and quickly found Microsoft's
[Zune Music Pass][6]. Their marketing blurb caught my eye:

>   A Zune Music Pass gives you unlimited access to millions of
>   songs you can stream or download and play on your Windows Phone,
>   PC, or Xbox 360.
>
>   Take advantage of powerful discovery tools like Mixview and
>   Smart DJ, which serve up music recommendations based on what
>   you already like.

## The Good

As you might expect, Zune has tight integration with Windows Phone
7. Finding songs is no different than finding apps, games, or
podcasts. The interface is clean, smooth, and fast. I've never had
any problems with it. Once you've found the songs you're looking
for, streaming or downloading them is a piece of cake.

Discovering new music is easy, too, though their "Smart DJ" service.
Just pick a song, artist, or album you like and it'll find more
stuff like it. It's not quite as good as Pandora, but it's close.

Zune has a web interface, but it seems like a lot more work went
into their desktop client for Windows. It's got all the same
information, but everything looks better and responds faster. Plus
it's got plenty of features that make you smile when you notice
them, like the spectrogram at the bottom.

## The Bad

The aforementioned desktop client is Windows-only, which leaves the
web interface for non-Windows folk like me. Their audio player uses
Silverlight, of course, so setting it up on Linux is a chore. But
the performance is even worse. Everything takes ages to load and
breaks playback unless you use their popout player. Compared to its
competitors, the Zune website is slow and feature-poor.

I encountered strange behavior while using Zune's website. Songs
just refused to play for me. I made sure my account was still active
(it was), then shot off a tweet to [@ZuneSupport][xaj] (the only
official support channel). Their response? ["Were you streaming
from your phone then tried to stream from the website?"][xak] You
can't use your phone and the website at almost the same time.
Ridiculous.

Microsoft claims you can stream music to your XBox 360, but the
fine print reveals that you need an XBox Live Gold membership to
do that. Since I don't have one and don't plan on shelling out
another $15/month for it, I don't know if it's any good or not.

## The Ugly

Plenty of music is totally absent from the Zune marketplace. For
instance, I'm a huge fan of [Cake][xal], but none of their music
is available to me. It shows up when I search for it, but I can't
stream, download, or buy it.

That's not even the worst part, though. I can understand some music
not being available in their marketplace. Look at how long it took
Apple to get The Beatles into the iTunes Music Store.

The worst part is: you still have to buy some music!  Even though
you pay $10/month for "unlimited access", you still have to pay for
some songs, albums, and artists.

I'm not sure if the band, label, or Microsoft is responsible. But
that's a damn good way to piss me off and make sure I don't listen
to your music.
