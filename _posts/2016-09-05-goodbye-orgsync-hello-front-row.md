title: Goodbye OrgSync, hello Front Row!
---

I am sad to announce that I am leaving [OrgSync][1]. This Friday will be my
last day after four amazing years together. OrgSync is a wonderful place to
work, full of great people making awesome software. I have learned so much from
everyone on the development team and I will miss them all.

I am excited for my next opportunity, which starts on Monday at [Front Row][2]!
Instead of moving to San Fransciso, where they're based, I will be working
remotely. I am extremely interested in Haskell, their language of choice, and
look forward to working with their talented team of developers to make great
educational tools.

Thanks again to the OrgSync development team, past and present: Aaron
Lasseigne, Amir Rajan, Cameron Desautels, Casey Foster, Chuck Barlow, Clifton
King, Cody Russell, Jim Barnett, Jim Clark, Joshua Griffith, Justin Powell,
Justin Steffy, Kevin Wade, Lars Levie, Lucas Harms, Matthew Farmer, Matthew
Tarantino, Seth Bonnie, Sonny Garcia, Tyler Lee, and Valarie Martin Stuart.
Y'all rock!
