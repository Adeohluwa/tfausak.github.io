title: Hello, World!
---

I discovered [GitHub Pages][1] this afternoon. That was lucky. I
nearly set up an EEE PC to run a [Mercurial][2] server with [Hyde][3]
to power a blog. GitHub saved me a lot of frustration there.

I'm excited about this blog because it's exactly what I've always
wanted in one: simple and straight to the point. I get to write
posts in the editor of my choosing. I get to use [Markdown][4]. My
blog posts are version controlled. I don't have to worry about
losing posts when migrating machines. I couldn't ask for much else.

Of course, a blog without content is just an HTML template. I plan
to post at least once a week. I hope to cover real-world problems
and solutions as a software developer. My focus will usually be on
the web, but not always. Topics may change drastically and without
warning.

If you want to know more about me or this site, check out the [about
page][5].
