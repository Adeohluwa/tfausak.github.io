unlike ios and android, windows phone 7 doesnt make it easy to
create nice home page icons for web pages/apps. this is especially
strange considering how heavily you can customize internet explorer
on the desktop. [1]

favicons dont work, apple-touch-icons dont work, you get the idea.
ie on wp7 takes a screenshot of the current page as is and pastes
it onto the home screen. in a lot of ways, thats good. unfortunately
it means the 173 pixel square icon on the home screen is going to
look like junk.

google has a workaround [2] that ive recreated. they show a button
to iemobile users using conditional comments. clicking the button
takes you to a splash page that you can pin to your home screen.
the splash page looks cool when its made into an icon. all it does
is redirect you.

the instructions on mine arent quite as pretty, but it works just
the same. you can customize the icon, title, and url with query
string parameters.

if you were going to deploy this on a real website, youd need a way
to prompt new wp7 mobile users to add a tile for your page. google
does this well.
