-   similar development flow
    -   bullet points of main ideas / outline or pseudocode
        -   good for establishing a structure
        -   not always needed, depends on skill and objective
        -   useful for collaborating
    -   first draft / most basic code that works
        -   most essays and code don't make it past this point
        -   it gets the point across and works, but it's not pretty
        -   often the author knows this
    -   revised, edited, published copy / peer-reviewed, tested, shared code
        -   takes a lot of time and, usually, a lot of people
        -   often covers cases you didn't think of initially ("wiser")

-   "An essay is something you write to try to figure something out."
    similarly, a program is something you write to try to do something
-   "Gradualness is very powerful."
    wrt combovers; works against programs, too, in the form of entropy

-   "They decided to rewrite the code from scratch."
    rarely do people restart essays from scratch
-   "Itâ€™s harder to read code than to write it."
    quite different than essays, which are much easier to read than write
