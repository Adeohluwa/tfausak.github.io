title: Your Code is an Essay
published: false

Writing code is a lot like writing an essay.
I'm not talking about the essays you write for school, though.
[Paul Graham's idea of essays][1] is closer to what I'm going for:
"something you write to try to figure something out."
Code is something you write to do something.

They take similar paths.
Both start as an idea in your head.
Then you might jot bullet points down in a notebook or type pseudocode into an editor.

Writing code is a lot like writing an essay.

They start off the same way, with an outline.
For code this means pseudocode or maybe a UML diagram.
Essays start with a list of main ideas and supporting facts.
In either case, this step can be skipped.

Then it moves on to the first draft.
It's the smallest, simplest thing that works.
It might not be pretty, but it gets the point across.
Usually the author is keenly aware of the concessions they've made.

Few things move on to the last step, a finished product.
Published essays get checked by friends and editors.
Code gets checked by friends, coworkers, and bosses.
This finished product is much more polished.
It handles edge cases and doesn't leave out viewpoints.

But why does this matter to you, a developer.

-   similar development flow
    -   bullet points of main ideas / outline or pseudocode
        -   good for establishing a structure
        -   not always needed, depends on skill and objective
        -   useful for collaborating
    -   first draft / most basic code that works
        -   most essays and code don't make it past this point
        -   it gets the point across and works, but it's not pretty
        -   often the author knows this
    -   revised, edited, published copy / peer-reviewed, tested, shared code
        -   takes a lot of time and, usually, a lot of people
        -   often covers cases you didn't think of initially ("wiser")
-   why does this matter (aka "so what?")
    -   use similar development techniques, as outlined above
        -   already use a lot of the same ones
        -   ask others for input on code, not output
        -   publish code
    -   read more code
        -   good writers read a lot, good coders should too
        -   ideally should be interesting
        -   not necessarily immediately relevant

-   "An essay is something you write to try to figure something out."
    similarly, a program is something you write to try to do something
-   "Gradualness is very powerful."
    wrt combovers; works against programs, too, in the form of entropy

-   "They decided to rewrite the code from scratch."
    rarely do people restart essays from scratch
-   "Itâ€™s harder to read code than to write it."
    quite different than essays, which are much easier to read than write
