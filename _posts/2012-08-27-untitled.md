-   all to easy to get too comfortable in a certain technology stack
-   get stuck in a rut working on the same stuff day in and day out
-   no opportunities to work on new tech
-   nor are there chances to explore every part of your tech stack

-   work on a pet project
-   can go at your own pace, follow your own coding style, pick your own tech
-   can be any scope (best to keep it limited so you'll actually finish)
-   choose new tech to learn new stuff
-   pick old tech to get a deeper understanding of what you know

-   solve programming puzzles (project euler, dailyprogrammer, etc.)
-   bite-sized, easy to solve quickly
-   useful to exploring new languages
-   usually covers all the basic concepts (conditionals, loops, etc.)
-   lots of conversation to see how other people solved them
