title: Real life garbage collection
---

Any computer scientist worth their salt knows about [garbage
collection][1]. It allows programmers to avoid thinking about
throwing away things when they're done with them. [Manual memory
management][2] sits at the other end of the spectrum. It forces
programmers to say when they're done with something so the computer
can do something else with it. They both have the same goal: a
program that doesn't gobble up memory.

Why would anyone prefer to manually manage memory? The same reason
people prefer manual transmissions over automatics. In fact, one
of my professors (Glenn Downing) used this exact analogy. With manual memory
management ([stick shift][4]), you get better gas mileage and
performance. You can even do things that are impossible in an
automatic, like engine braking. But in an automatic, you don't have
to think about anything. Your mind is free to think about things
that aren't related to the internals of the car.

That's a solid analogy, and it has served me well. I recently thought
of another, more personal, one: I manually manage my stuff; other
people let garbage collection handle their stuff.

I regularly go over everything I own, deciding whether or not it's
worthwhile to keep it. If it's not, I give it away, sell it, or
throw it out. No sense in keeping something that's useless. However,
most other people that I know only throw things out when they move,
or during spring cleaning. It doesn't bother them to hang on to
something worthless; they can just put it in their closet and forget
about it.

But when they do move, it's a huge deal. They have so much junk
that they haven't thought about in so long that they have a hard
time even processing it. Eventually they'll probably give up and
put it in a box regardless. It may stay in a box until the next
time they move.

Either you have to stop the world every now and then to clean things
up, or you have to keep track of things as you go.
