title: One year of Haskell Weekly
---

One year ago I published the first issue of [Haskell Weekly][1], a free email
newsletter about the Haskell programming language. For the first few months I
ran it in stealth mode, making sure the idea made sense and ironing out all the
kinks. In August I [announced it here on my blog][2]. Since then, about 20 new
people subscribe each week. The most recent issue went out to 1,010
subscribers.

I expected that as more people subscribed, the relative number of people who
actually opened the newsletter would go down. Much to my delight the open rate
stayed relatively constant. I must be doing something right because 61% of
subscribers opened the most recent issue. According to MailChimp, the industry
average is 17%.

The story for the number of people who clicked on links in the newsletter is
basically the same. For the most recent issue, 27% of subscribers clicked on at
least one link. The industry average is only 2%.
