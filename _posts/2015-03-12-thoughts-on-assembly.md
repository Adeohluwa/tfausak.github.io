title: Thoughts on Assembly

![][1]

[Assembly][2] helps you "turn ideas into great products with people around the world".
That sounds wonderful, but what does it mean?
To find out, I put [Ledger][3], one of my side projects, on Assembly.

Ledger tracks your expenses on the web.
I wrote the back end in Haskell and the front end in JavaScript with React.
It is a complete working application, and I hosted it on OpenShift.
You can try it out at [ledger.fausak.me][4].

I started by answering questions about my project.
What was the point of it?
(To easily track expenses through the web.)
Did it have a monetization strategy?
(No, but making money off it is possible.)
What did it compete against?
(More robust software like Mint and YNAB.)

I never considered some of these questions before.
Answering them made my project feel more official than it was.
I worked on Ledger on and off by myself for a month;
even calling it a "product" instead of a "project" seemed weird.

Regardless, I wanted to put my best foot forward.
I dutifully and honestly answered all the questions.
Then I transferred the code from my repositories to theirs.
At this point I felt like I had invested in Assembly.
I anxiously awaited whatever I would get out of it.

Assembly keeps new projects in "stealth mode" until they get ten members.
To get members, I shared Ledger on social media and in the chat on Assembly.
Other than that, I did no marketing.
As a result, I failed to recruit enough members.
Part of the problem was that I didn't (and still don't) understand what members are.
You might think they are contributors, but you can become a member without completing any bounties.
As far as I can tell, they are people who expressed an interest in your product.

Anyway, bounties make up the core of products on assembly.
I created bounties for all the features and bugs I could think of.
Easy ones, hard ones, front end ones, back end ones --- you name it.
Nobody did any of them.
A few were claimed but never completed.
One person even developed code that I would have accepted if they made a pull request, but they never did that.

My takeaway from that is that people are uninterested in working for free.
More specifically, they avoid products on Assembly without monetization plans.
(Or maybe my product was boring or the code was gross or nobody heard about it.)

Another problem with the bounty system is that switching between products is hard.
It takes a long time to get up to speed with a product.
Especially to get to the point where you can comfortably contribute code to it.
And once you do, it makes more sense to keep contributing to that one instead of switching to another.

If, unlike me, you manage to complete some bounties, you will earn coins.
The best way to think about coins is like shares.
The founders get a bunch of them.
When you finish a bounty, you will earn a few.
If the product makes money, that money will be distributed among the people who own coins.
This part of Assembly is conceptually simple.
I would like to see how it plays out with a cash-positive product.
