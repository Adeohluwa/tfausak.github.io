title: Thoughts on Assembly
---

![][1]

- i had an existing project
- i saw a blog post advertising assembly on hacker news
- i had heard of assembly before but wasn't clear about how it worked
- i decided to transfer my project to assembly in order to learn more about it
- i transferred my project to their repository
- i filled out all the information about my project
- i posted about my project in the chat and on social media
- i managed to recruit a couple members
- nobody completed any bounties though
- i had both front and back end bounties, both easy and hard
- i used haskell for the back end and react for the front end
- some people claimed bounties then did nothing
- they didn't even ask for help even though i offered
- someone even had a solution that i would've accepted as a pr
- so i don't think people want to work on projects for free (no surprise there)
- i also didn't market properly
- however i did learn how assembly works
- the founder gets coins, which are like shares
- completing a bounty gets you coins
- if the project makes money, it is distributed among the coin holders
- it's really straightforward
- i wish it was easier to discover stuff to work on (it looks like they're working on it)
- as a user, it's hard to work on projects a la carte because of how long it takes to learn about a project
- also you're better off working on one project because your domain knowledge will allow you to make more bounties
- this is like dominating a tag on stack overflow
- i'm still not clear on what it means to be a member of a project
