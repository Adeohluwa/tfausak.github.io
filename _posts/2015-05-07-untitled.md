- replaced symbolic errors with detailed errors
  - this is what rails 5 will use
  - nicer interface
  - replaces `symbolic` with `details` (slightly different return type)
  - replaces `add_sym` with `add` (different arity)
  - warning in 1.6
- prevented proc defaults from being eagerly evaluated
  - they were evaluated due to an oversight when adding this feature
  - should never have been eagerly evaluated in the first place
  - no warning in 1.6
- renamed model to object
  - initially designed for ActiveRecord models
  - useful for any type of object
  - warning in 1.6
- removed transaction support
  - proved not to be a good default
  - if we don't provide the default, the `transaction` method doesn't add much
  - warning for `transaction` method in 1.6
- added results to invalid outcomes
  - allows returning common object from interaction
  - mostly useful when updating an existing record
  - no warning in 1.6
- use hashes with indifferent access throughout
  - prevent DoS attack based on symbol keys
  - no warning in 1.6
- file filter accepts anything that respond to `#eof?`
  - used to special case uploaded files for rails
  - this allows for more IO-type objects
  - no warning in 1.6
