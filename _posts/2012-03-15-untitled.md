title: Dropdown Menu in Twitter Bootstrap's Collapsed Navbar
---

## Motivation

-   login link got lost
-   user menu got lost, too
-   especially on mobile (70% of visitors) -- android in particular (50%)

## Solution

-   make the login link a colorful button
-   make the user menu a big dropdown
-   position it at the same place on every page
-   make it available to mobile clients

## Problems with this approach

-   brittle -- relies on particular values from bootstrap
-   requires adding another class
-   requires adding more css
-   can't put too much in the button, since it won't collapse

## Alternative approaches

-   specify a data-no-collapse attribute
    -   match in responsive css with :not([data-no-collapse="true"])
    -   requires monkeypatching bootstrap-responsive.css
    -   :not selector doesn't work in IE <9

    -   [attr] selector doesn't work in IE 6
        -   http://www.quirksmode.org/css/contents.html#t13
    -   this is used on famigo.com (IE ~= 3%)
-   create a new dropdown-menu-no-collapse class
    -   add to list of selectors everywhere dropdown-menu appears
    -   requires monkeypatching bootstrap.css and bootstrap-responsive.css
