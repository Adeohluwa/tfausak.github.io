![My battle station][1]

- didn't used to like multiple monitors
- liked a single large monitor instead
- usually supported better in software
- transported my laptop back and forth from work
- identical monitors at home and work
- still felt productive on the go

- recently moved from austin to dallas
- telecommute every day now
- flanked my laptop with two identical monitors
- grew to love it
- more screen real estate to display mostly static things
- like chat, email, itunes, calendar, to-do list, documentation, etc.
- much less context switching
- just turn my head a little instead

- huge advocate of multiple monitors now
- software support is actually pretty great
- use moom to position windows exactly
- physical layout is important, too
- need monitors arrayed along a circle with your head at the center
- align all the tops or bottoms (brackets useful for this)
- need lots of desk space, too

- particularly useful having a retina (2x) center screen
- makes difference in quality (retina IPS vs regular TN) very obvious
- mostly design on the retina screen, then check on regular
- probably more useful for designer-types instead of developers

- setup details, since everyone always asks
- 15" retina macbook pro
- flanked by asus ve278q monitors
- connected with displayport
- apple bluetooth keyboard and magic mouse
- keep headphones and gaming mouse stashed away
- ikea galant desk with A-frame legs and locking casters
- power strip attached to underside of desk
- keeps cords out of the way
- allows easy repositioning, since only once cord
