title: Type safe web services in Haskell with Servant
---

- <http://haskell-servant.github.io>
- unlike a lot of haskell libraries, the documentation is excellent
- in particular the tutorial is very easy to follow
- almost no boilerplate
- extremely type safe
- api definition is separate from server
- allows generating documentation, js client code, and haskell client code
- this means you can consume an API by describing it and automatically generating the client code
- writing new generators isn't too hard (upcoming post about this)
- handlers are easy to write and get all the right args
- servant handles the http layer beautifully
- never have to think about content types in your handlers
- giving a talk about this on wednesday over hangouts on air
- <https://plus.google.com/events/c6jk82adnqbveqm4eqk4dn7r624>
- so far the only thing i don't like is the connascence of position between the api definition and the server
- i wrote a fully fledged example called factory
- <https://github.com/tfausak/factory>
- it defines an API, implements a server, generates documentation, and makes JS and HS client code
