(ruby 1.8.7 / rails 3.2.13)

every so often i hear about a database leaking
usually they have a bunch of email addresses and passwords
users of whatever service got hacked should be concerned
in decreasing terms of badness, this is how passwords are stored:

1. in plain text
2. obfuscated (rot13/caesar cypher)
3. encrypted (3des)
4. hashed (md5, sha-1, etc.)
5. salted and hashed
6. key derivation function'd (bcrypt, pbkdf2, etc.)

i hear about these leaks through hacker news or reddit
invariably the comments decry the database's company as incompetent
why are they not using bcrypt? don't they know better?

most people do know better
but the cost/benefit doesn't always make sense
securing password storage protects against one thing only:
leaking a database
that's a pretty rare occurrence
there is usually lower-hanging security fruit to go after first

all that being said, it's better to use bcrypt
there's no reason not to
and it's surprisingly easy to update a legacy system to use it
