Today is my last day at [Famigo][]. Over the past two and a half years, I've gone from an acquiantance to an intern to a full-time employee to the senior developer. I've learned so much during my time at Famigo and I'm sad to leave.

Starting on Monday I'll be swapping my Django hat for a Ruby on Rails one and joining the excellent people at OrgSync.
