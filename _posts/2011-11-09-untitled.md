played magic since urza destiny [aaa] (1998, 13 years)
first deck was enchanter [bbb]
now have over 7000 cars

played casually with friends
briefly played standard in ravnica block [ccc]
won a (pre-?) release event for shadowmoor [ddd]

didnt have anyone to play with
started drafting with magic 2010 [eee]
immediately took a liking

cheaper than standard, legacy, etc
cheap ($12 for 3+ packs, 2+ hrs)
easier to build than casual
more playing, less organizing

relies on skill instead of money
lots of different kinds of skill (picking, building, playing)
still strong luck aspect (like magic at large)
