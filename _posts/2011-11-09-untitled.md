I'm an avid [Magic: The Gathering][fff] player. Magic is a collectible
card game created in the early '90s. I started playing in 1999,
around the release of [Urza's Destiny][aaa].  A 60-card preconstructed
theme deck, [Enchanter][bbb], introduced me to the game. It hooked
me immediately, and today I have more than 7,000 cards.

I played and traded casually with friends for years after that.
Competitive Magic didn't appeal to me. I had a good time with my
friends, and we were all about the same power level.

As friends graduated and moved away, the pool of available players
shrunk. I had to look elsewhere to find competitors. During the
[Ravnica block][ccc], I played in a handful of standard constructed
[Friday Night Magic][ggg] tournaments. I lost. A lot. My casual
playstyle and frugal decks didn't lead to much success.

I soon discovered another type of competitive play: limited. Unlike
standard, you don't build your deck ahead of time. When you show
up, you are given a random assortment of cards to build your deck.
I won the first limited tournament I played in, a [Shadowmoor][ddd]
release event.

The next year I started playing in [Magic 2010][eee] draft tournaments.
It was the most fun I had playing Magic since I started playing
more than ten years ago.

One thing that drew me to limited drafts was the price. For $12,
you get at least three booster packs (which retail for about $3
each) and about three hours of entertainment. At the end of the
night, you walk away with all your cards. If you won two or more
matches, you end up with even more packs. Compare that to standard,
where one card in your deck can cost you more than $40 -- and you
need four of them to be competitive

It's a lot harder to build decks in constructed, too. You have to
sift through thousands of cards. You have to spend a lot of time
keeping your cards organized so you can find the cards you're looking
for. In draft, you have only 42 cards to build your deck from.

Ultimately that's all just gravy. The real reason why limited is
better than constructed is simple: it promotes skill over wealth.
In constructed formats, with enough money, you can win by netdecking.
In limited formats, everyone's on the same playing field. More money
doesn't get you better cards. Better skill gets you better cards.

Drafting takes many different kinds of skills. You have to be able
to pick good cards, read your opponents as they pick cards, build
a good deck, and of course play your deck well.
