![Magic: The Gathering logo][1]

I play [Magic: The Gathering][2]. I have since 1999, about six years
after it's creation. A 60-card preconstructed theme deck from [Urza's
Destiny][3] called [Enchanter][4] hooked me. Today, I have more
than 7,000 cards and play a handful of games every week.

When I started, I just played and traded casually. My friends and
I had a good time for years. I wasn't even aware of competitive
Magic. Even if I was, it wouldn't have appealed to me.

As my friends grew up and moved away, the pool of available players
shrunk. I needed to look elsewhere to find competitors if I wanted
to keep playing. So, during the [Ravnica Block][6], I played in a
handful of standard constructed [Friday Night Magic][7] tournaments.
I lost. A lot. My casual playstyle didn't lead to a lot of victories.

I soon discovered another type of competitive play: limited. Unlike
constructed, you don't build your deck ahead of time. Instead, you
got a random assortment of cards when you showed up. You had to
build your deck on the spot using those cards. I won the first
limited tournament I played in, an [Eventide][8] release event.

The next year I started playing in [Magic 2010][10] draft tournaments.
It was the most fun I had playing Magic since I started ten years
ago.

I was initially drawn to draft by the price. For $12, you get three
booster packs and about three hours of entertainment. Not bad,
considering you walk away with all your cards at the end of the
night. If you win a couple of matches, you end up with even more
packs. Compare that to standard, where one card in your deck can
cost more than $40 -- and you need four of them to be competitive.

Building decks is much harder in constructed formats, too. You have
to sift through thousands of cards, look for archetypes online, and
consider the metagame. Drafting is simpler: you have to build the
best deck from the 42 cards you picked.

Of course, picking those 42 cards can be pretty tough. That's another
thing I like about draft, though: it requires lots of different
skills. You have to be able to pick good cards, build a good deck,
and play well. And you have to do all that quickly, without any
external help.

That's all just gravy, though. The real reason why limited is better
than constructed is simple: it promotes skill over wealth. In
constructed, you can win more games by spending more money. In
limited, you can't spend more money. The only way to be better is
to be more skillful.
