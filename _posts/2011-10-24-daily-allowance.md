Starting tomorrow (Monday, 2011-10-17), I'm going to give myself a
$20 allowance every day. I'm doing this to curtail my spending. It
requires the least thought on my part and has easily measurable
metrics.

If I regularly have too much cash, I'll lower my allowance. Too
little and I'll raise it.

Working with an allowance instead of a budget makes it easier for
me to think about saving for or splurging on things.

In the interest of ... not much in particular, I'm going to chronicle
my spending.
