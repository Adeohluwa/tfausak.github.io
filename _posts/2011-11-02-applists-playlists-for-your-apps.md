title: 'Applists: playlists for your apps'
---

At Famigo, we're working hard to make smartphones safe for
families. We're also trying to help families find good apps for
their phones. Our site has tons of curated content, but there's
only so much we can do. Plus, you know your family better than
anyone else. You know which apps they like.

We want to make it easy to recommend apps to your family and
friends. If you use the Famigo Sandbox, you already have a
great tool at your disposal: sandbox sharing. It's quick and easy
to share a link to your sandbox from within our app. (I don't have
many apps on my phone, so my sandbox is a little barren. Shaun,
our Android developer, has tons of apps in his sandbox.)

For those of you that don't (or can't) use our app, I'm proud to
present a new tool to you: Famigo Applists. They're like
playlists for your apps!

Using our simple web-based editor, you can create your own applists.
All you have to do is hunt down a couple apps that you like and hit
save. You'll be presented with your freshly-minted applist in no
time.
