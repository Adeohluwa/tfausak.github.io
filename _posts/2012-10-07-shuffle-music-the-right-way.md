title: Shuffle Music the Right Way
---

![iTunes shuffle playlist][1]

I have problem: I love listening to music, but I hate picking music
to listen to. In a perfect world, I could press play and listen to
music I like all day. Services like [Pandora][2] get really close.
The only problem is that I don't enjoy listening to new music all
the time.

A couple months ago, [a Hacker News comment][3] suggested a way to
avoid hearing the same songs over and over again while shuffling.
I thought it might solve my problem, so I set up [three smart
playlists][4] and grouped them into a folder:

-   5-star songs I haven't heard since yesterday
-   4-star songs I haven't heard for a week
-   3-star songs I haven't heard in a month

I've been listening to it every day since then and I love it. I did
have to tune the delays a little. I was hearing 5-star songs too
often and 4-star songs not often enough, so I changed the rules
from 1 day / 1 week / 1 month to 3 days / 9 days / 27 days. With
that setup, I get about six hours of music to listen to every day,
which is perfect for me. You may need different delays; my library
is pretty small --- only 618 songs.

Obviously this only works if you've rated a substantial number of
the songs in your library. I use the following rating system, which
is why I completely ignore 1- and 2-star songs:

1.  I hate this song! I can't even list to it once.
2.  I don't like this song, so I probably won't listen to it again.
3.  This song is okay. I won't skip it if it comes on.
4.  I like this song and I'd listen to it again.
5.  I love this song! I could listen to it on repeat.

This system has the neat side effect of conveniently confirming
your ratings. If you're sick of hearing a song, just bump its rating
down a star. If you haven't heard enough of it, push the rating up.
(I recommend [I Love Stars][5] for quickly rating songs.)

I only have one gripe with this setup: I wish it played new songs
more frequently. I'd prefer to hear a 5-star song I've only heard
once over a 5-star song I've heard a couple dozen times.
