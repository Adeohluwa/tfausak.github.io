title: Shuffle Music the Right Way
---

![iTunes shuffle playlist][1]

I have problem: I love listening to music, but I hate picking music
to listen to. In a perfect world, I could just hit play and listen
to music I like all day. Services like [Pandora][2] get really close,
but I don't enjoy listening to new music all the time.

A couple months ago, [a Hacker News comment][3] suggested a way to
avoid hearing the same songs over and over again when shuffling. I
thought it solved my problem pretty well, so I set up [three smart
playlists][4]:

-   5-star songs I haven't heard since yesterday
-   4-star songs I haven't heard for a week
-   3-star songs I haven't heard in a month

Then I grouped them into a folder and let it run wild. I've been
listening to it for the past couple months and I love it.

I had to tune the delays from 1, 7, and 30 days to 3, 9, and 27
days for 5-, 4-, and 3-star songs, respectively. My library is
pretty small, though --- just 618 songs spanning 55 albums. These
smart playlists give me about six hours worth of music to listen
to every day.

Obviously this only works if you've rated a substantial number of
songs in your library. I used the following rating system, which
is why I completely ignore 1- and 2-star songs:

1.  I hate this song! I can't even list to it once.
2.  I don't like this song. I probably won't listen to it again.
3.  This song is okay. I won't skip it if it comes on.
4.  I like this song. I'd listen to it again.
5.  I love this song! I could listen to it on repeat.

This system has the neat side effect of conveniently confirming
song ratings. If you're sick of hearing a song, bump its rating
down a star. If you haven't heard enough of it, push the rating up.
(I recommend [I Love Stars][5] for quickly rating songs.)

I only have one gripe with this setup: I wish it played new songs
more frequently. I'd prefer to hear a 5-star song I've only heard
once over a 5-star song I've heard a couple dozen times.
