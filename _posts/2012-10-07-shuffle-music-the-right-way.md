title: Shuffle Music the Right Way

![iTunes shuffle playlist][]

- usually drive myself crazy listening to the same songs all the time
- especially when i find a new song i listen to it on rpeat
- ideally i just hit play and listen to music i like all day
- don't always want to listen to new music (on pandora et al)

- rate every song in your library
    1.  hate it, can't even listen to it once
    2.  don't like it, won't listen to again
    3.  it's ok, could listen again
    4.  like it, want to listen again
    5.  love it, could listen to it on repeat
- create three smart playlists
    1.  five star songs you havent heard in a X days
    2.  four star songs you havent heard in a Y weeks
    3.  three star songs you havent heard in Z months
- put them all in a folder (or meta smart playlist) and enjoy

- i have 618 songs spanning 55 albums
- 5 star ~ 3 days
- 4 star ~ 9 days
- 3 star ~ 27 days

- conveniently confirm rating of songs
- if youre sick of hearing it, bump it down a star
- if you havent heard it enough, push the rating up
- i recommend using [i love stars][] for easy rating

- id like this better if the decay could be adjusted to play count
- that way new high-rated songs would be played more frequently than old ones
- plus it would effectively balance the play counts in your library
