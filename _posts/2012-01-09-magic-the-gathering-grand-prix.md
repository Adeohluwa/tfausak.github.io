I participated in my first Magic: The Gathering Grand Prix this
weekend. ([Magic][1] is a collectible card game. [Grand Prix][2]
are the biggest Magic events open to everyone.) My brother convinced
me to go since this Grand Prix was hosted our own backyard, at the
Austin Convention Center.

I'm not a professional Magic player. I started playing in 1998 and
have been playing casually since then. My friends and I most commonly
play vintage with each other. Not too long ago I tried my hand at
playing vintage (and standard) competitively, but it was expensive
and demoralizing. It did turn me on to drafts and sealed tournaments,
though. I won a small sealed tournament at a release event a few
years back. Recently, I've been playing a lot of drafts.

All this to say: I'm well-versed in Magic. I know the game, cards,
and formats well.

I did not like the Grand Prix.
