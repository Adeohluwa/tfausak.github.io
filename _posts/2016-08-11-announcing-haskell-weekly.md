title: Announcing Haskell Weekly
---

I started a free weekly Haskell email newsletter called [Haskell Weekly][].
Issues contain about seven hand-picked links to the best Haskell content from
the past week.

I publish new issues every Thursday morning. To date, I have published 15
issues. 90 people subscribe to Haskell Weekly, with an average open rate of
66% and an average click rate of 34%.
