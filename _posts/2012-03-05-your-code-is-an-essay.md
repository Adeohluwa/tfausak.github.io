title: Your Code is an Essay
---

Writing code is a lot like writing an essay.

They start off the same way, with an outline.
For code this means pseudocode or maybe a UML diagram.
Essays start with a list of main ideas and supporting facts.
In either case, this step can be skipped.

Then it moves on to the first draft.
It's the smallest, simplest thing that works.
It might not be pretty, but it gets the point across.
Usually the author is keenly aware of the concessions they've made.

Few things move on to the last step, a finished product.
Published essays get checked by friends and editors.
Code gets checked by friends, coworkers, and bosses.
This finished product is polished and handles edge cases.

But why does this matter to you, a developer.

You can use similar development techniques.
Peer review is the de facto standard for essays.
Ask for input on the code, not the output.
Publish the code instead of showcasing the project.
If you're feeling adventurous, convince writers to use coding best practices.

The easiest thing you can do to improve your code is to read more code.
Good writers read far more than they write.
What you read should interest you.
Not much else is required -- it doesn't even have to be useful.

-   similar development flow
    -   bullet points of main ideas / outline or pseudocode
        -   good for establishing a structure
        -   not always needed, depends on skill and objective
        -   useful for collaborating
    -   first draft / most basic code that works
        -   most essays and code don't make it past this point
        -   it gets the point across and works, but it's not pretty
        -   often the author knows this
    -   revised, edited, published copy / peer-reviewed, tested, shared code
        -   takes a lot of time and, usually, a lot of people
        -   often covers cases you didn't think of initially ("wiser")
-   why does this matter (aka "so what?")
    -   use similar development techniques, as outlined above
        -   already use a lot of the same ones
        -   ask others for input on code, not output
        -   publish code
    -   read more code
        -   good writers read a lot, good coders should too
        -   ideally should be interesting
        -   not necessarily immediately relevant
