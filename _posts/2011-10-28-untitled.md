One of my favorite things about working for a startup is being able to work remotely.

Reaons I love working remotely:

-   Girlfriend lives in another city. I can travel to see her and work from her apartment.
-   Some days it's really nice out and I want to go for a bike ride. I can take an hour or two off in the middle of the day and head home to ride.
-   Some nights I get too drunk and don't want to wake up early the next morning. I can stay home until lunch to get myself put together.
-   Sometimes I just want to save gas. I don't commute very far to work, but it still makes a difference.

All this is facilitated by:

-   Campfire. Let's us keep in touch regardless of where we are. (IRC would work just as well.)
-   Skype. We can do our daily standup from anywhere. (Google Chat works just as well.)
-   Awesome coworkers. They put up with me working remotely. (I put up with them, too.)
-   Remote development instance. I'm not tied to any particular hardware or software. (I could run Linux on my machine, but I like OS X.)
