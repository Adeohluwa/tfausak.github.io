title: Escaping Liquid Tags on GitHub Pages
---

note: this information is correct at time of posting
for jekyll 0.12.0 and liquid 2.4.1 on github pages

my blog is hosted on github pages
which uses the liquid templating engine

i post code samples
which sometimes have parts that look like liquid tags
so i need to escape them
this turned out to be harder than i thought

there are four options

the first is ugly
lets say you want to escape "{% thing %}"
then you need to do
    {{ "{% thing " }}%}
similarly, for "{{ thing }}"
    {{ "{{ thing " }}}}
not only is it ugly, it's confusing.

the second is roundabout
you can assign the thing to be escaped to a variable
    {% assign thing = '{% thing %}' %}
    {{ thing }}
this of course gets to be annoying if you need to escape a lot of things

the third only existed for a while
but github pages supported it (and still does)
you can use the "{% literal %}" tag to escape stuff
    {% literal %}
        {% thing %}
        {{ thing }}
    {% endliteral %}
this method is easier to understand, easier to use, and less error-prone than the previous two.
unfortunately it only existed for a brief while in liquid (around 2.2.2)

the final method is the best, clearest, and has the benefit of still being supported
it's just like the third method, but the name of the tag has changed
instead of "{% literal %}", use "{% raw %}"
    {% raw %}
        {% thing %}
        {{ thing }}
    {% endraw %}
