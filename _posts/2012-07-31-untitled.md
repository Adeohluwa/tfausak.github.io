a couple months ago, i noticed i did the same thing every morning at work. i'd plonk myself down in my chair, hook up my laptop, and open about ten tabs worth of analytics. i needed to check everything in the morning:

-   traffic to our site
-   errors or warning on the backend since yesterday
-   api traffic and status
-   traffic to our app
-   new reviews on the play store
-   new user accounts, MAUs, AARRR, etc.
-   total user accounts (hit any milestones?)
-   popular apps launched from the sandbox
-   aggregate sandbox usage stats

so for the first half hour or so of every morning, i wouldn't do any work. i'd just pore over stats.

that in and of itself isn't a problem, but i would open the same set of tabs every day. and i'd only use a little bit of the information on each one, but they took forever to load. everyone else in the office had a similar routine.

i decided we could do better. i briefly toyed with the idea of setting up a real-time dashboard in the office, but i went in the other direction instead: daily digest emails. i figured i could condense all the vital information into an email and send that out every morning.

so i spent a day or two soliciting opinions from my coworkers; what's important, what do you check in the morning, that kind of stuff. i jammed it all into a wishlist and sat down to turn it into code. we already had all the hard bits: email handling and dashboards for displaying data. i just had to combine them.

it turned out to be really easy -- and really useful. a rare combination, but much appreciated. it started out pretty simple but i continued to add things as weeks went by until it was the only thing i checked in the morning. i only went to the dashboards if something was amiss.

in the end, it took me a couple days worth of work, but it saves me (and everyone else at famigo) about half an hour every morning. i can't imagine starting my day without it any more.
