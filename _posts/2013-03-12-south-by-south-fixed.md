> the best way to get to SXSW. A weekend of bike riding and beer
> drinking to kick off the week long festival.

Over the weekend I biked from Dallas to Austin. It was one of the
most challenging and rewarding things I've done in my life. I spent
12 hours in the saddle riding 193 miles and climbing 5,296 feet.

I rode with five other guys and one support driver. We all had a
great time riding and partied hard at the end of each ride. I
wouldn't have been able to do it without their support, and it
would've been a lot more boring without them around. Thanks to
Charles, Cliff, Dave, Gabe, John, and Timmy for making my first
SXSF an amazing experience!

## Day 1: Dallas to Waco

The first day started off ominous and only got worse from there.
Clouds loomed and the forecast called for thunderstorms. That's not
the bad part, though. A strong wind came up from the south and
fought us all day. And when I say strong, I mean a constant 20 mph
in your face with gusts up to 30 mph.

After battling the elements for 70 miles, I couldn't take any more
and gave up. I wanted to go farther, especially since the planned
route was 129 miles, but the wind took too much out of me. I'm happy
that I made it through a metric century and more than half way,
though.

## Day 2: Waco to Taylor

Day two felt like a reward for even attempting to brave the previous
day. The sun shined all day, keeping us warm and dry. The wind
shifted and blew from the north, giving us a tailwind. With that
at out backs, we made good time and covered 87 miles in five hours.

## Day 3: Taylor to Austin

Compared to the first two days, the last one felt like a joyride.
It was even nicer than the day before and had less than 40 miles
to cover. We got a late start after enjoying some authentic Texas
BBQ. Going into Austin meant rolling up and down hills, which was
a lot of fun.

Cresting a hill and seeing the Austin skyline felt amazing. It meant
the end of our trip was literally in sight. We rode straight in to
the Capitol for a photo op, then got some food and beers before
heading our separate ways. Not a bad way to spend a Monday.
