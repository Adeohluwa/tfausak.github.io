title: Upgrade to a Multi-Screen Battlestation
---

![My workstation][1]

Up until a month ago, I hated multiple-monitor setups. Instead, I
preferred one large high-resolution monitor, for two main reasons:
Most software, like Windows 7's [Aero Snap][2] and OS X's [Mission
Control][3], works better with only one display; and I kept my
workstations in sync by hauling my laptop to and from work everyday.
My desk at work looked exactly like the one at home -- same monitor,
mouse, and keyboard. I kept my laptop shut and plugged into an
external monitor in both places.

That changed recently, though, when I moved from Austin to Dallas.
Now that I telecommute every day, I can have one permanent workstation
at home and not worry about lugging my laptop around. So that's
exactly what I did. I took my two identical monitors and flanked
my laptop with them. I quickly grew to love it.

It's hard to overstate the utility of having enough screen real
estate to display everything at once. Especially things that stay
the same most of the time, like email, chat, and to-do lists. Turning
my head a couple inches is a lot easier than switching between a
bunch of open apps. It also helps keep me focused by keeping relevant
information like documentation visible while I work.

Moving tackled one of the reasons I avoided multiple monitors in
the past, but what about the software? Mission Control still
frustrates me occasionally, but [Moom][5] helps reign it in. With
it I can exactly position every window to maximize the usefulness
of my screens. It's the only utility I need to make my setup a
dream.

I'm surprised it took me so long to join the ranks of multiple-monitor
developers like [Mark Pilgrim][7] and [Jeff Atwood][8]. I've got a
ways to go before I can hold a candle to the folks in
[/r/battlestations][9], but I don't think I'll ever go back.

## Tech Specs

If you're curious about what hardware I'm running, read on.

-   15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display (MacBookPro10,1)
-   Two Asus VE278Q monitors connected with DisplayPort
-   Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse
-   Ikea Galant desk with birch veneer, silver A-frame legs and
    locking casters
-   Power strip screwed onto the underside of the desk

Having the high-desnity Retina screen side-by-side with low-density
screens makes testing a piece of cake. I agree with Marco that web
designers ["really, really need to get a Retina MacBook Pro"][10].
Surrounding it with regular displays lets you test 2X and 1X versions
without using a different device.
