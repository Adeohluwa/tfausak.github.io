Working on the same thing every day has a way of getting you stuck
into a rut. You know your codebase like the back of your hand, but
that's all you know. You haven't had any opportunities to work with
new technology or fully explore every part of your current tech
stack.

Don't get me wrong -- it's not necessarily a bad thing. The rut
you're stuck in might be highly productive. Staying focused on one
thing for a long time lets you develop a solid mental model of it.
You can make changes with surgical precision.

But what if you want to branch out and keep your mind sharp? Maybe
learn a new language or play with a new database. Well, you're in
luck. It's not too hard and it only takes a little bit of time.
Here's how I do it.

## Stay in the Loop

This one is the easiest because you probably already do it. Follow
a site that keeps you abreast of what's going on, like [Hacker
News][3] or [proggit][4]. That way you'll knwo about new technology,
even if you don't get a chance to use it.

## Pet Project

Start a small project to scratch an itch. Think of something you
do frequently that can be automated or improved with a program. It
can be a small thing like a to-do list or a big thing like an XML
parser. In my experience, it's better to keep it small so that
you'll actually finish it.

There are a lot of good things about working on your own project.
You get to pick the whole tech stack. If you want to use the latest
and greatest to learn how it works, go for it. If you want to stick
with what you know so you can focus on the implementation, more
power to you. You also get to go at your own pace, which can be a
blessing and a curse.

## Programming Puzzles

Programming puzzles are on the other end of the spectrum. They're
a lot like riddles: easily digestible and quickly solveable. Sites
like [Project Euler][5] and [/r/dailyprogrammer][6] have tons of
puzzles covering the whole gamut of difficulty from easy to impossible.

I like using these to learn new programming languages. Puzzles often
involve all the key parts of a program: conditionals, loops,
functions, and file I/O. They're not complicated enough to worry
about complexity or best practices, which is a boon when trying to
learn a language. Plus there are often large communites around
puzzle sites. Those people can show you clever ways to solve a
problem or introduce you to languages you don't know about.
