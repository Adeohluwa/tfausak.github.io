title: 'Dropping out: a year later'
---

About a year ago, I dropped out of college. I was in my senior year
studying computer science at [The University of Texas at Austin][1].
If I had stayed in school, I would have graduated by now.

I agonized over the decision for months. Everyone I knew told me
it was a bad idea. Every single person. Even my therapist, who I
started seeing because college depressed me, recommended against
it.

I didn't have a plan. I had a part-time job. The only thing I was
sure of was that I was depressed and school was the likely cause.
So I braced myself to disappoint a lot of people and went to fill
out the paperwork.

It was a beautiful day in late September when I went to the registrar's
office. I was nervous. This was the biggest, hardest decision of
my life. Walking out of the office that morning holding the piece
of paper that made it official felt wonderful.

Soon afterward, I scheduled a meeting with [Famigo][2] to break the
news. How they were going to take it was anyone's guess. I figured
I might get fired. Fortunately, they didn't mind. In fact, they
brought me on full time and I've been working with them (and loving
it!) since.

So here it is, a year later. Most of my family and friends have
come to terms with it, although plenty of them still think dropping
out was dumb. Ultimately, that doesn't matter. I am immeasurably
happier. I stand by [what I said][3] when I dropped out:
