## Overview

---

### What is Servant?

> Servant is a set of libraries that makes building Haskell web services a
> breeze.

> [Servant] provides a family of combinators to define web services and
> automatically generate the documentation and client-side querying functions
> for each endpoint.

---

### Why Servant?

- **Concision**: Don't repeat yourself.

- **Flexibility**: Use whichever libraries you want.

- **Separation of concerns**: Let Servant think about HTTP.

- **Type safety**: Get compile-time guarantees about your API.

## What does it look like?

---

### API description

    type PeopleAPI = "people" :> GET '[JSON] [Person]

This specifies our API. It defines a single endpoint, `GET /people`, that
returns a JSON array of `Person` values.

---

### Server implementation

    peopleServer :: Server PeopleAPI
    peopleServer = return [Person { name = "Alice" },
                           Person { name = "Bob" }]

This implements our API. It will be checked at compile time against the
specification.

---

### Client derivation


    api :: Proxy PeopleAPI
    api = Proxy

    getPeople :: EitherT ServantError IO [Person]
    getPeople = client api host where
        Right host = parseBaseUrl "http://example.com"

We need the `api` proxy to get the type-level API at the value level. Then we
can use `client` to generate functions for consuming the API. The type
(`EitherT ...`) means that `getPeople` will either return a list of people or
an error, and it can do IO.

---

### JavaScript client

    js :: String
    js = jsForAPI api

This generates a string that has code for a JavaScript client that is a lot
like the Haskell client from the last slide.

---

### Markdown documentation

    md :: String
    md = markdown (docs api)

    instance ToSample [Person] [Person] where
        toSample _ = Just [Person { name = "Jane" }]

Generating documentation is like generating JavaScript. Note that we have to
manually specify how to generate examples for the documentation. These could be
customized on a per-endpoint basis by using `newtype` wrappers.

## So what?

---

### Force multiplier

Defining an API as a type allows you to implement a server and generate clients
without doing too much more work. You can be sure that everything stays in
sync at compile time.

---

### Explicit expectations

Everything you need to know about the API is in the type. There is almost no
tribal knowledge. You can use this to codify your understanding of someone
else's API, or share a Markdown representation of your own.

---

### Service-oriented architecture

Since you get clients for free, you can generate clients for all your APIs.
That makes them much easier to consume, especially if you wrap that simple
client in a friendlier service.

---

### Extensible

Need client code for a new language, new Rust or Elixir? You can write a
general converter once and use it for all of your APIs. Use the same machinery
that Servant uses to generate JavaScript and Haskell clients. (Then share it
with the community so everyone can use and improve it!)

## Real life

---

### Complicated API

    type API
        = "deeply" :> "nested" :> "things" :> Get '[JSON] [Thing]
        :<|> "events" :> Capture "id" Int :> Get '[JSON] Event
        :<|> "cgi" :> MatrixFlag "bin" :> Get '[PlainText] String
        :<|> "share" :> QueryParams "network" String :> Post '[JSON] ()
        :<|> Header "Cookie" String :> "auth" :> Get '[HTML] String
        :<|> "create" :> ReqBody '[JSON, XML] Person :> Post '[JSON] Person
        :<|> "index" :> Get '[HTML] (Headers [Header "X-Whatever" Int] String)
        :<|> ReqBody '[HTML, JSON, XML] Thing :> Post '[HTML, JSON, XML] Thing

APIs can be combined with the `:<|>` combinator.

---

### Deeply-nested routes

    "deeply" :> "nested" :> "things" :> Get '[JSON] [Thing]

You can combine routes with the `:>` combinator. Think of it like a slash for
paths. This one describes `GET /deeply/nested/things`.

---

### Captured variables

    "events" :> Capture "id" Int :> Get '[JSON] Event

Capture parts of the URL with the `Capture name type` combinator. The capture
will be automatically converted into the appropriate type. If it can't, Servant
will return a 404.

---

### Flags and params

    "cgi" :> MatrixFlag "bin" :> Get '[PlainText] String
    :<|> "share" :> QueryParams "network" String :> Post '[JSON] ()

Query params come at the end, after a question mark. Matrix params are in the
path, separated by semicolons. So you might have `/a;matrix/b?query`. Flags
are false if they're not there and true if they are. Params can either be
singular (`QueryParam`), in which case they can be assigned to a value, like
`foo=bar`. Or they can be plural (`QueryParams`), in which case they can be
assigned to many values, like `foo[]=bar1&foo[]=bar2`.

---

### Request headers

    Header "Cookie" String :> "auth" :> Get '[HTML] String

This means you expect the "Cookie" header to have a string value. It will be
passed to the handler as a `Maybe String` because it might not be there.

---

### Request bodies

    "create" :> ReqBody '[JSON, XML] Person :> Post '[JSON] Person

This endpoint accepts a `Person` serialized as either JSON or XML. If it's
missing or can't be decoded, Servant will handle returning a 400 error with an
appropriate error message.

---

### Response headers

    "index" :> Get '[HTML] (Headers [Header "X-Whatever" Int] String)

This says that the endpoint will return an "X-Whatever" header as an integer,
in addition to it's normal string return type.

---

### Content types

    ReqBody '[HTML, JSON, XML] Thing :> Post '[HTML, JSON, XML] Thing

This endpoint accepts a `Thing` as HTML, JSON, or XML. Then it returns that
thing in any of those formats. The cool thing is that you get this for free.
Servant handles all the conversions.

---

### Don't repeat yourself

Let's say you have an API that looks like this:

    type API
        =    "User"   :> "byid" :> Capture "guid" UUID :> Get '[JSON] User
        :<|> "People" :> "byid" :> Capture "guid" UUID :> Get '[JSON] Person

Since everything is just combinators, you can extract the duplication.

    type GetEntity path kind
        = path :> "byid" :> Capture "guid" UUID :> Get '[JSON] kind

    type API
        =    GetEntity "User"   User
        :<|> GetEntity "People" Person

---

### Escape hatch

Servant is built on top of WAI, which is Haskell's standard web server
interface (think Rack for Ruby or Ring for Clojure). You can combine Servant
with a normal WAI application --- i.e., any other server.

    type CompleteSite
        = ServantAPI
        :<|> Raw

Now when you host that server, any request not served by Servant will fall
through to another WAI application.

---

### Nesting

You can nest APIs easily with the familiar `:>` combinator.

    type APIv1 = ...
    type APIv2 = ...
    type API
        =    "api" :> "v1" :> APIv1
        :<|> "api" :> "v2" :> APIv2
