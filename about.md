![Taylor Fausak][1]

# {{ page.title }}

Howdy! My name is Taylor Fausak (pronounced \[fɑːsæk\], like "fah
sack"). I'm a 23-year-old software developer living in Dallas,
Texas. I currently work for [Famigo][2]. I studied Computer Science
at [UT Austin][3] for a couple years, but I don't have anything to
show for it.

The best way to reach me is by sending an email to [taylor@fausak.me][4].
If you want to find me elsewhere on the web, try [Facebook][5], [GitHub][6],
[Google+][7], or [Twitter][8].

This blog is hosted in [a public repository on GitHub][9] and powered
