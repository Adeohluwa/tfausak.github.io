# {{ page.title }}

Howdy! My name is Taylor Fausak. I'm a 24-year-old software developer
living in Dallas, Texas. I currently work for [OrgSync][2]. I studied
Computer Science at [UT Austin][3] for a while, but I don't have
anything to show for it.

The best way to reach me is by sending an email to [taylor@fausak.me][4].
