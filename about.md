# **{{ page.title }}**

Howdy! My name is Taylor Fausak. I'm a 22-year-old software developer.

![Portrait of me][1]

I live in Austin, TX, where I work for [Famigo][2]. I studied
Computer Science at [UT Austin][3] for a while, but I don't have
anything to show for it.

If you want to get a hold of me, you can send me an email. My email
address is [taylor@fausak.me][4]. If you don't like email, you can
try one of the websites listed below.

## Elsewhere

This is my home on the web, but there are lots of other places you
can keep up with me.

-   I like to ride my bicycle. I used [Endomondo][5] to track my
    rides.
-   Although I went without it for a long time, I have a [Facebook][6]
    just like 800 million other people.
-   [GitHub][7] manages all my code. Even the code for this very
    website!
-   I read [Hacker News][8] nearly every day, but I rarely post
    things or vote.
-   Similarly, I can't pry myself away from [Reddit][9]. I'm little
    more than a lurker there, too.
-   Gaming isn't as important to me as it was years ago, but I still
    occasionally fire up [Steam][10].
-   [Tumblr][11] captured a lot of my teenage angst, for better or
    worse.
-   I haven't found a use for it yet, but I update my [Twitter][12]
    every now and then.
