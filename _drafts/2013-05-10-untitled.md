Usually when a database leaks, it contains a bunch of email addresses and passwords.
Any user with a row in the database should be aware that someone could discover their credentials.
Depending on how their data is stored, it can be either simple or impossible to extract the passwords.
From least to most secure, these six formats cover the majority of password storage techniques:

1.  Plain text
2.  Obfuscated (Caesar cipher)
3.  Encrypted (Triple DES)
4.  Hashed (MD5)
5.  Salted and hashed
6.  Computed from a key derivation function (bcrypt)

It's unequivocally better to store passwords more securely.
There are no downsides and brute-force attacks become orders of magnitude harder.
Any greenfield project should use bcrypt (or another key derivation function like PBKDF2 or scrypt).

But what about existing projects?
Upgrading to a new scheme isn't trivial because current passwords need to be migrated.
In fact, the user shouldn't be able to tell that anything changed.
The old system should be silently deprecated and replaced with the new one.

Here's how to do exactly that with Rails 3.2.13 and bcrypt-ruby 3.0.1 on Ruby 1.9.3-p392.

## Before

Let's say you're in the worst possible scenario: you store passwords in plain text.
Hopefully you don't actually do this, but it makes this example a lot simpler.
The same principles work regardless of how you store your passwords.

Assuming a straightforward account model, you might authenticate users with a class method.
All it does is try to find the account, then compare the passwords.
If everything checks out, it returns the account.
In all other cases, it returns `nil`.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.authenticate(username, password)
    account = find_by_username(username)
    account if account && password == account.password
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

## During

We want to jump straight to the best case scenario and start using bcrypt.
Three things are necessary to get that done:
add another field to the account model;
add a handful of new methods;
and modify the authenticate model.

Up first is adding a new field to the account model.
We need to store the derived key bcrypt generates.
A simple migration takes care of this step:

{% highlight ruby %}
class AddBcryptHashToAccount < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :accounts, :bcrypt_hash, :string
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need a couple utility functions.
They'll allow us to see which accounts use bcrypt, set the password, and compare strings against it.
These all require the bcrypt-ruby gem, so add `gem 'bcrypt-ruby'` to you Gemfile.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'bcrypt'
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  include BCrypt
  def bcrypt?
    bcrypt_hash.present?
  end
  def bcrypt
    @bcrypt ||= Password.new(bcrypt_hash) if bcrypt?
  end
  def bcrypt=(new_password)
    @bcrypt = Password.create(new_password)
    self.bcrypt_hash = @bcrypt
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly the authenticate function needs to modified to do a couple things.
It should compare using bcrypt if the account has been updated.
If it hasn't, it should compare using the old method, then generate a new hash using bcrypt and delete the old one.

{% highlight ruby %}
def self.authenticate(username, password)
  account = find_by_username(username)
  return unless account
  if account.bcrypt?
    account if password == account.bcrypt
  elsif password == account.password
    account.bcrypt = password
    account.password = nil
    account.save!
    account
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

## After

At some point you'll want to remove everything that's still stored in the old format.
For accounts that haven't updated yet, a new password must be generated.
You can either email it to them or they can rely on your password recovery service.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'bcrypt'
class RemovePasswordFromAccount < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    account_ids = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.
      select_all('SELECT id FROM accounts WHERE bcrypt_hash IS NULL').
      map { |e| e['id'] }
    remove_column :accounts, :password
    return if account_ids.blank?

    passwords = account_ids.length.times.
      map { SecureRandom.hex }
    bcrypt_hashes = passwords.
      map { |e| BCrypt::Password.create(e) }
    cases = account_ids.zip(bcrypt_hashes).
      map { |a, b| "WHEN #{a} THEN '#{b}'" }
    update_sql <<-SQL
      UPDATE accounts
      SET bcrypt_hash = CASE id #{cases.join(' ')} END
      WHERE id IN (#{account_ids.join(', ')})
    SQL
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Testing

Depending on how your tests are set up, switching to bcrypt could slow them down.
Changing the work factor is the easiest way to avoid this slowdown.
In the next version, bcrypt-ruby will support setting the cost with `BCrypt::Engine.cost = x`.
For the time being, monkey patching is the way to do.
Drop this into `spec/support/bcrypt.rb`:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'bcrypt'
module BCrypt
  class Engine
    Kernel.silence_warnings do
      DEFAULT_COST = 1
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
